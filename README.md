# dss-plugin-metaheuristic-optimization

A Dataiku plugin illustrating metaheuristic optimization

It contains one python Jupyter notebook template with a basic example illustrating the use of the DEAP library on a small optimization problem with 2 variables.

The notebook was adapted from [here](https://github.com/pepper-johnson/sack_lunch/blob/master/Notebooks/GA/Basic%20GA%20Example%20-%20DEAP.ipynb) and is therefore based on the Chapter 6 from “Genetic Algorithms and Investment Strategies” by Richard Bauer Jr.
More explanations are available on [this blog](https://medium.com/@pasdan/basic-ga-via-python-deap-603736eb6b87).
